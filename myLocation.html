<h2>My Favorite Location to Visit</h2>

<p>
  My favorite location to visit is the Maldives because it is one of the most
  beautiful and peaceful places in the world. The Maldives is famous for its
  clear blue water, white sandy beaches, and relaxing atmosphere. I like this
  location because it is a perfect place to enjoy nature and take a break from
  busy everyday life.
